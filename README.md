# zowsup

zowsup is a python whatsapp-protocol project base on [yowsup](https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup/).

Since the original yowsup project has not been maintained for a long time, we forked yowsup and some associated projects(axolotl, consonance) and intergrated into an All-In-One Project and keep updating with latest version of Whatsapp.
